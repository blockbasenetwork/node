# BlockBase Node App
BlockBase is the power of Blockchain applied to Databases. It uses sidechains for database storage, and those sidechains are connected to the EOS platform through EOS smart contracts.

## Development State
Here you can find the current project development. It's not ready for usage yet. We are working hard to have a version ready for testnet soon.

## Software Usage
Both a sidechain service requester or service provider only need to use the BlockBase Node App to access their corresponding system services.
